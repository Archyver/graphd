libpdb.a - primitive database

Layered on top of the "workhorse" libaddb.a, this library's
goal is to present a user interface to the graphdb server process
that makes sense of data in terms of "primitives" -- tuples of
type, name,  valuetype, value, scope, timestamp, etc.

To libaddb, it's all just data.  libpdb knows that bytes 16..31
of this data are the big-endian GUID of a scope object.

Much of libpdb is really not so much code as _conventions_;
a lot of it is macros in pdb.h that access certain bytes in certain
ways.

Services:
      - read, allocate primitives;
      - iterate over all primitives in a database
      - remove a complete database

Tools:
 	pdbdump -- dump contents of one pdb database.

Uses:
	libaddb, libgraph.

Used by:
	Graph database

Implemented in:
	C
