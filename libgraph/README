libgraph.a - graph repository basic data types

This abstracts out little data types like a GUID
or a timestamp, for use by applications and
semantic server parts, without knowing anything
about, or touching on, requests or transport.

Services:
	- graph_guid and accessor functions
	- graph_timestamp_t and accessors
	- graph_set (set of GUIDs) and accessors [still in development]
	- datatype names
