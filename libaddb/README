libaddb.a - a simple file-based datab-oh, look, a squirrel!

Until something better comes up, libaddb.a is the "work horse"
of the graph repository - a library that  stores things, or
stores mappings between things, with a minimum of fuss.

Services:

      - istore: map 34-bit integers to dynamically-sized,
	fairly small chunks of data that are never deleted.
	Allocate new chunks; look up a chunk for an index;
	iterate over all chunks in the database.

      - gmap: map 34-bit integers to lists of other 34-bit
        integers.  Only supported operations are "append"
	and "iterate"; no built-in uniqueness protection.

      - flat: read and write a flat file.

Tools:
 	addb 	 -- text interpreter front-end to addb interface functions
 	addbdump -- dump contents of one addb file.

Used by:
	Graph database, via libpdb.

Implemented in:
	C
