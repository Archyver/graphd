es -- event server

	This is poll(2) on steroids.

	Poll events -- incoming data, outgoing capacity,
	errors, timeouts -- are dispatched to handlers.
	There's one handler per file descriptor.
	Handlers can subscribe to and unsubscribe
	from events, and can hook up to at most one
	timeout per handler.

USES
	cl for logging, assertions
	cm for allocation

USED-BY
	graphd
	
TIMEOUTS
	Timeouts are allocated as separate objects
	and explicitly associated with sessions.

THREADING
	The library is implicitly single-threaded.
	I.e. it doesn't interfere with threads in the
	back, but there's only one thread calling
	poll() at any one time.
	Caller locks if they need to.
