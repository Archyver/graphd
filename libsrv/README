libsrv.a - protocol server

The non-protocol-specific trappings of a text-based protocol
server (see the "uncopying server" paper in cvs:graph/gr-uncopying.txt).

This is factored out in an attempt to later make it usable
for other servers (and this module truly doesn't know a node
from a hole in the ground), but it's still far from at the
point where it's sensible or well structured -- don't bug
me about it just now [Mar 2005].

Services:
	- pid-file allows external shutdown of server, locks
	- monitoring process restarts server thread after crash
	- configuration file defines interfaces for listening
	- command line arguments
	- loglevel set on command line or in configuration file
	- run as uid, gid instead of root

Tested:
	Nowhere near enough.

Used by:
	Graph database

Implemented in:
	C
